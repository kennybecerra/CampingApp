# CampingApp

## Description
 Sample website showcasing skillset in Frontent Developemnt. The web application uses HTML5 syntax along with CSS Grid/Flexbox for layouts. I personally like to use SASS as a preprocessor for productivty and postcss/autprefixer for broswer compatibility. I implement Mobile first design and use responsive design throughout the development process.  You can also see my web development setup which includes Webpack 4 with seperate config files for production and development. A link to my Starter Project Template can be found [here](https://github.com/kennybecerra/ProjectTemplate).

## Organization

Two main folders; `dist` folder contains production ready files. `src` folder contains the files I used in development. In order to use github pages I have copied all `dist` files into root directory as well. Check out the CampingApp website [here](https://kennybecerra.github.io/CampingApp/)
